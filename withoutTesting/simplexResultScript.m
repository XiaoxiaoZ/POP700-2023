write the solution according to final matrix and the corresponding basic variables


function result=simplexResult(M)
 %result is an array and M the matrix which contains the equations
 %this function associates variables and to values (𝑥1, 𝑥2 , ...,xn , 𝑆1 , S2 ,..., 𝑆n )
 %returns an array with the solution
end

function optimum=optimumValue(M)
 %M is the matrix which contains all the equations
 %returns the optimum value
end
